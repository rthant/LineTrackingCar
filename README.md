# LineTrackingCar
ECE252 Final Project - Spring 2018

The project involved using a robot car to follow a black line by utilizing three infrared sensors placed under the car. PWM control could not be achieved in the time the project was due, leading to a lack in speed control. This is what causes the system to often skip the track and stop, but under most cases the car can accurately turn as dictated by the line it is following. The project video with a demonstration of the robots operation can be seen here:

To get this code to work on your FRDM KL25Z, you must download Keil uVision and configure your computer to interface with the microprocessor. The code can be seen in the asm_main.s file. If you are having problems, follow NJIT's installation and setup guide in the ECE395 Lab manual: http://ecelabs.njit.edu/ece395/ECE395_Manual_v3.17.pdf
