ECE252 Final Project - Spring 2017

This was a project I had worked on for my Microprocessors class at NJIT, where we learned how to program and use an FRDM KL25Z using Assembly through the Keil uVision5 IDE. The project involved using a robot car to follow a black line through utilizing three infrared sensors placed under the robot. The project resulted in a fairly robust system which consistently follows a black line through curves and straight lines. Under extreme turning conditions however, the robot may drive past the line and stop. The project video with a demonstration of the robots operation can be seen here:

To get this code to work on your FRDM KL25Z, you must download Keil uVision and configure your computer to interface with the microprocessor. If you are having problems, follow NJIT's installation and setup guide in the ECE395 Lab manual: http://ecelabs.njit.edu/ece395/ECE395_Manual_v3.17.pdf
